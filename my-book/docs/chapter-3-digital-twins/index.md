# Chapter 3: Digital Twins with Gazebo & Unity

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of digital twins in robotics
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Design simulation worlds with obstacles and environments
- Implement sensor simulation for realistic perception
- Understand Unity's role in high-fidelity visualization
- Bridge Gazebo and Unity for combined simulation capabilities

## Module Overview

Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems that enable testing, validation, and development of robotic systems in safe, controlled environments. This chapter explores two major simulation platforms used in robotics: Gazebo for physics-based simulation and Unity for high-fidelity visualization.

This module is designed to be completed over 3 weeks, with each week focusing on specific aspects of simulation:

- **Week 1**: Gazebo simulation concepts and physics engines
- **Week 2**: Sensor simulation and environment design
- **Week 3**: Unity integration and bridging with Gazebo

The content combines theoretical understanding with practical examples to give you hands-on experience with simulation environments essential for humanoid robot development.
