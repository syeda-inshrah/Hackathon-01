## Prompt

Generate a comprehensive specification for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2). The content must cover: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions. The use of rclpy to bridge Python Agents to ROS controllers. A detailed section on URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids. The specification must adhere to the Constitution's demand for functional code examples, pedagogical clarity, and the '## Learning Outcomes' structure. Acceptance criteria must require that all ROS 2 code snippets successfully run on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Humble/Iron) using the specified Docusaurus-titled format.

## Response snapshot

Specification for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) has been created covering:
- ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions
- rclpy integration for bridging Python agents to ROS controllers
- URDF implementation for humanoid robots
- Comprehensive user scenarios with acceptance criteria
- Functional requirements and success metrics
- Pedagogical clarity with learning outcomes structure

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for ROS 2 nervous system module
- 🧪 Tests: 
- 📁 Files: specs/002-ros2-nervous-system/spec.md, specs/002-ros2-nervous-system/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan or /sp.clarify
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification addresses all aspects of ROS 2 nervous system including nodes, topics, services, actions, rclpy integration, and URDF for humanoids.
