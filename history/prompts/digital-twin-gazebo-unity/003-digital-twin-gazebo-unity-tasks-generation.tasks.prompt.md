## Prompt

Generate an actionable, dependency-ordered tasks.md for the feature based on available design artifacts. The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Response snapshot

Successfully created an actionable, dependency-ordered tasks.md for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). The tasks have been organized into 8 phases with 82 specific tasks, covering all aspects from setup to final polish. Each user story from the specification has been mapped to its own phase with specific, executable tasks. The tasks follow the required checklist format with checkboxes, sequential IDs, and clear file paths. Parallel execution opportunities have been identified with [P] markers. The MVP scope focuses on User Story 1 (Gazebo Physics Simulation) as a minimal viable module.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task breakdown for digital twin module implementation
- 🧪 Tests: 
- 📁 Files: Generated tasks.md with 82 individual tasks
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are properly formatted and organized by user story priority with clear dependencies.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): 
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of Phase 1 tasks
