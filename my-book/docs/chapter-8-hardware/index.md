# Chapter 8: Hardware & Lab Infrastructure

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the hardware requirements for Physical AI and humanoid robotics
- Select appropriate workstation configurations for simulation and development
- Set up edge computing platforms for real-world robot deployment
- Configure sensor systems for perception in robotic applications
- Plan and design laboratory infrastructure for robotics education

## Module Overview

Physical AI and humanoid robotics require specialized hardware to handle the computational demands of perception, planning, and control. This chapter covers the essential hardware components, from high-performance workstations for simulation to edge computing platforms for robot deployment.

The module covers:

- **Workstation Requirements**: High-performance computing for simulation
- **Edge Computing**: Jetson platforms for robot deployment
- **Sensor Systems**: Cameras, IMUs, and other perception devices
- **Laboratory Setup**: Infrastructure for robotics education and research

This chapter provides guidance for setting up both individual development environments and larger laboratory installations.
