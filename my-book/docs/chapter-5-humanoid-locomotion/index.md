# Chapter 5: Humanoid Locomotion & Manipulation

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of bipedal locomotion and balance control
- Implement kinematic models for humanoid robots
- Design control systems for stable walking patterns
- Create manipulation strategies for humanoid robot hands
- Integrate locomotion and manipulation with perception systems
- Apply control theory to humanoid robot systems

## Module Overview

Humanoid robots must master two fundamental capabilities: locomotion to move through environments and manipulation to interact with objects. This chapter explores the complex control systems required for bipedal walking and dexterous manipulation, both of which are significantly more challenging than their wheeled or fixed-base counterparts.

This module is designed to be completed over 3 weeks, with each week focusing on specific aspects of humanoid capabilities:

- **Week 1**: Kinematics and dynamics of humanoid robots
- **Week 2**: Bipedal walking and balance control
- **Week 3**: Manipulation and grasping with humanoid hands

The content combines theoretical understanding with practical examples to give you hands-on experience with the unique challenges of controlling anthropomorphic robotic systems.
