# Chapter 1: Foundations of Physical AI

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the core principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Explain how physical systems differ from traditional digital AI
- Identify the key components of a robotic system
- Recognize the relationship between sensing, computation, and action

## Module Overview

This chapter establishes the foundational concepts for understanding Physical AI and humanoid robotics. We'll explore what makes AI "physical," how embodied intelligence emerges, and the fundamental components of robotic systems. These concepts form the foundation for understanding how humanoid robots perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world.

This module is designed to be completed over 3 weeks, with each week focusing on specific aspects of Physical AI:

- **Week 1**: Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- **Week 2**: Physical laws, constraints, and their impact on robot design
- **Week 3**: Sensors and actuators that enable physical interaction

The content combines theoretical understanding with practical examples to give you hands-on experience with the concepts that underpin all subsequent modules.
