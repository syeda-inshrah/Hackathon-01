# ROS2 Robotics Curriculum Constitution

## Core Principles

### Education-First Design
Every curriculum module starts with clear learning objectives; Content must be self-contained, independently understandable, and well-documented; Clear pedagogical purpose required - no sections without educational value.

### Practical Implementation Focus
Every theoretical concept includes hands-on exercises and practical examples; Students learn ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and humanoid robotics through direct implementation; Support both beginner-level tutorials and advanced challenges.

### Test-Driven Learning (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every lesson includes pre-defined learning outcomes that must be validated; Students demonstrate understanding through practical assessments before progressing; Follow Understand-Apply-Evaluate cycle strictly enforced.

### Integration with Real Robotics Systems
Focus areas requiring integration with real-world robotics frameworks: ROS 2 communication patterns, Simulation environments (Gazebo), NVIDIA Isaac platforms, Humanoid robot control systems.

### Modularity and Accessibility
Text-based documentation ensures accessibility; Structured content with progressive complexity; Modules designed to be taken independently for flexible learning paths.

### Docusaurus Best Practices
All content follows Docusaurus standards for navigation, sidebar structure, versioned documentation, and responsive design.

## Curriculum Standards
Technology stack requirements: ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill), Gazebo simulation, Python 3.8+, NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem, Docusaurus v3+; Compliance with educational accessibility standards; Deployment through static hosting with versioned releases.

## Development Workflow
Content review requirements: Technical accuracy verified by robotics engineer, Educational effectiveness reviewed by curriculum designer; All content must pass accessibility checks before merging; Student feedback incorporated in quarterly updates.

## Governance
This Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation of educational impact, approval by technical and educational leads; All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with both technical and educational standards; Content complexity must be justified by learning objectives.
