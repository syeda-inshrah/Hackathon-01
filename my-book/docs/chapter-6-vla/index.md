# Chapter 6: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems
- Integrate multimodal perception with language understanding
- Implement action planning from natural language commands
- Apply LLMs for task planning in robotic systems
- Bridge vision and language models with robotic action execution
- Design cognitive planning systems for humanoid robots

## Module Overview

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) represents the convergence of three critical AI capabilities: computer vision for perception, natural language processing for understanding commands, and robotic action execution. This chapter explores how these systems work together to enable humanoid robots to understand and execute complex tasks based on natural language instructions.

This module is designed to be completed over 3 weeks, with each week focusing on specific aspects of VLA integration:

- **Week 1**: VLA concepts and multimodal understanding
- **Week 2**: OpenAI Whisper integration for voice commands
- **Week 3**: LLM task planning and action execution

The content combines theoretical understanding with practical examples to give you hands-on experience with the cutting-edge integration of AI and robotics.
