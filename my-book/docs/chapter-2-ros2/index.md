# Chapter 2: ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the ROS 2 architecture and its components
- Create and implement ROS 2 nodes using Python and rclpy
- Design communication patterns using topics, services, and actions
- Define robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Apply ROS 2 concepts specifically to humanoid robot systems

## Module Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) serves as the communication and coordination framework for complex robotic systems. This chapter introduces ROS 2 as the "nervous system" of robotic applications, providing the infrastructure for different components to communicate and coordinate effectively.

This module is designed to be completed over 3 weeks, with each week focusing on specific aspects of ROS 2:

- **Week 1**: ROS 2 architecture and fundamental concepts
- **Week 2**: Nodes, topics, services, and actions with practical examples
- **Week 3**: Python integration with rclpy and URDF for humanoid models

The content combines theoretical understanding with practical Python examples using rclpy, emphasizing how these tools apply to humanoid robot systems.
