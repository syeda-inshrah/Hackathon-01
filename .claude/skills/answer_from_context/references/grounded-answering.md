# Grounded Answering Guidelines

## Objective
Ensure all responses are strictly grounded in retrieved textbook content.

## Key Principles
- Answers must be fully supported by the provided context.
- Do not introduce information that is not explicitly present.
- Prefer direct phrasing from the book over paraphrasing.

## Failure Handling
If the context does not contain the required information:
- Explicitly state:
  "This information is not present in the textbook."

## Why This Matters
Grounded answering prevents hallucinations and ensures academic accuracy,
which is essential for educational AI systems.
