# Chapter 7: Capstone Project

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Integrate all modules learned throughout the course into a cohesive system
- Design and implement an autonomous humanoid robot capable of voice interaction
- Apply perception, planning, and control systems in a real-world scenario
- Demonstrate the complete Physical AI pipeline from perception to action
- Evaluate and refine complex robotic systems

## Module Overview

The capstone project brings together all the concepts learned throughout this course into a comprehensive demonstration of a humanoid robot system. Students will implement an autonomous humanoid robot that can receive voice commands, navigate to objects, manipulate them, and execute complex tasks.

This module is designed to integrate all previous modules:
- **Module 1**: The robotic nervous system (ROS 2)
- **Module 2**: Digital twins (Gazebo & Unity simulation)
- **Module 3**: AI brain (NVIDIA Isaac for perception and navigation)
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action integration

The project will result in a working system that demonstrates the complete pipeline of Physical AI capabilities.
